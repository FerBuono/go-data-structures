# Go Data Structures
This project contains various data structure implementations in **Go**, created for the assignature "Algoritmos y Programación II" lectured at FIUBA (Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Buenos Aires).

## Overview
The project includes implementations of the following data structures:
- [**BST (Binary Search Tree)**](./bst/)
- [**Dynamic Stack**](./dynamic-stack/)
- [**Graph**](./graph/)
- [**Hash Table**](./hash/)
- [**Heap (Priority Queue)**](./heap/)
- [**Linked List**](./linked-list/)
- [**Linked Queue**](./linked-queue/)
- [**UnionFind**](./union-find/)

### BST (Binary Search Tree)
A binary search tree that supports standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and search. It also supports range queries and iterators.

### Dynamic Stack
A stack data structure that grows and shrinks dynamically based on the number of elements.

### Graph
A graph data structure that supports directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted graphs with basic operations like adding and removing vertices and edges.

### Hash Table
A hash table (dictionary) implementation using separate chaining for collision resolution.

### Heap (Priority Queue)
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is used to implement priority queues.

### Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a reference (link) to the next element in the sequence.

### Linked Queue
A linked queue is a queue data structure implemented using a linked list. It supports FIFO (First In, First Out) operations.

### Union-Find
A union-find data structure (disjoint-set) with path compression and union by rank.
